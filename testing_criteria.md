# Testing criteria 

## Differents fnctionalities of TCPLS

- Stream Mutiplexing
- Migration from one connection to another
- Multiple connexions (for on application)

## What we can mesure

- Mesure the reaction to failures
    - Connection migration if better interest
    - Use of the multiple connections when there is a failure on one of them
- Mesure the reaction to big files (on multiple connections)
- Mesure what happend when multiple path are saturated (in contrast to MPTCP ?)
- Stream Mutiplexing ? How well it works ?
